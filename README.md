# KGX
Knowledge Graph eXchange is an open-source toolkit to convert and translate knowledge graphs between different platforms and formats.

Designed for interoperability and flexibility, GraphBridge helps users bridge structured graph models from systems like Cognite Data Fusion (CDF), Neo4j, Azure Digital Twins, RDF stores, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- Convert data model definitions (e.g., YAML from Cognite) into:
  - Neo4j-compatible CSVs or Cypher scripts
  - Intermediate/neutral formats (planned)
- Support for:
  - Node extraction
  - Relationship mapping
  - Basic property handling
- Designed with extensibility in mind to support additional backends
